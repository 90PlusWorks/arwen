# Arwen's portfolio
Imaginary artist Arwen is used to showcase a portfolio.
Porfolio website is here: https://90plusworks.github.io/arwen/
# The website features a horizontal scroll using the mousewheel in the top div with the thumbnail images. 
# For Mobile, this feature is not implemented, so instead use the arrow buttons to go to a specific image. 
The user can also click on the thumbnail at the top to display an image.
