    <h1>Artist Info:</h1>
    I'm <strong>ARWEN</strong> and I'm an imaginary multi-medium artist based in the universe.<br><br> After graduating from the <strong>Western Desert Acadamy of Art</strong>, I began my freelancing career by creating commercial art in wood carving of sarcophagi for the royal family and their printing industry. I've been creating commissions for thousands of years and have been in the employ of Pharaoh Ramesses II from 1230 to 1213 BC. Some work I consulted on or helped with during the ages are shown here. I currently do artwork and consulting for popular businesses such as <strong> Random Glow </strong> and <strong>Them drop-dead Apples</strong>.<br><br> I also love creating custom artwork for ordinary people such as Juan, Ren, Aam, John and Jane.
I enjoy working with others to create a social experience and interconnected artworks. <br><br>In my free time, I like to swing on silk curtains while binge-watching my favorite TV shows.<br><br> I'm open for commissions. Please email me at <strong>Arwen@protonmail.com</strong> to share your commission request and learn more about my art process.</div><br><br>
