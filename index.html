An HTML "tag" is a piece of markup language used to indicate the beginning and end of an HTML element in an HTML document.
The "tag" is included in <tag> inside "smaller"< and "larger"> than symbols.
"Tag" for: <!doctype> does not need a OFF "tag", but 
"Container tags" such as: html is swithed ON like this:<html lang="en"> and has an OFF "tag" </html> 
The / means OFF or done.
Other "container tags include" headings ON <head> OFF</head>, Page title ON<title> and OFF</title> etc, <author>Me</author> -->
<!-- "Container tags" have a ON tag:<head>Some content, incl tags & OFF tag</head> -->
